<h2 align="center">Day 1: May 1, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to fork a GitHub repo without using a CLI, updated CSS of the Writing page of my website, added images of my books, and grouped files into folders in GitHub repo of my website (learned how to add folders into my repo in the process).

**Thoughts:** It was daunting to return to working on my website after almost a whole month, but now I am starting to regain my focus on it. Life would be easier if I would use a CLI, but I am avoiding because it only means I would have to install programs in my computer. I do not feel very confident about the memory of my computer yet. The memory looks small.

<h2 align="center" id="2">Day 2: May 2, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Returned to GitHub on night of Day 1 to add code to verify website ownership on Google Search Console. This afternoon, used flexbox to organize the photos of my books on my Writing page.

**Thoughts:** This is the first time I'm using Google Search Console. I do not like the way my Writing page appears at the moment, it triggers my obsessive-compulsive tendencies. It really does. I got lost in my own code today, though. Because I forgot to comment my CSS last March, and because I use generic values for my id attributes.

<h2 align="center" id="3">Day 3: May 3, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Commented my CSS, merged the CSS of my homepage and Writing page, fixed some errors, decided to apply most of my CSS to the whole website for consistency, and organized the contents of my CSS file from "sitewide", to "per-page", and to "per screen". (CSS file does not contain those specific words, but it's in this organization.)

**Thoughts:** I'm more focused on coding today.

<h2 align="center" id="4">Day 4: May 4, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Returned to Codepen the night of Day 3 to give my website a more responsive design. Also renamed its Writing page to "Books". Today, customized the measurements of the product div elements and designed the buttons to match the overall site design.

**Thoughts:** I feel frustrated with how my buttons are not aligned.

<h2 align="center" id="5">Day 5: May 5, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Tried using CSS grid to align the buttons in the Books page, failed, and returned to flexbox. Learned about grid in the process. Spent remaining time figuring out why main and footer were overlapping. Changed background colors of flexboxes for clearer view of what might be happening.

**Thoughts:** I still feel upset that the buttons are not aligned. Whenever I align them, problems happen. The images disappear, the gaps between the images and the product titles get too big, or some of the images get bigger than the other images. Maybe I should work on the layout of the whole page first before proceeding to the products, the problem could be in the overall layout.

<h2 align="center" id="6">Day 6: May 6, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Resorted to using a blank doc as a sort of duck debugger for mapping out the logic of my code. Figured out why main and footer were overlapping. Part of main was a flexbox within an element, and footer was in a flexbox with a section from main. Footer was following a measurement that had nothing to do with the display case. Fixed it by adding a gap between items of the outer flexbox. Removed background colors. Moved page intro from behind the navbar by increasing margins. Started working on aligning the buttons again.

**Thoughts:** Being unable to fix the footer left me a bit depressed. Now that it's fixed, all of those emotions are suddenly gone. I feel so inspired, I have returned to attempting to align the buttons again. There is hope.

<h2 align="center" id="7">Day 7: May 7, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about CSS grid, restructured HTML to align everything on my Books page, made images zoom on hover in devices that use a cursor, and edited all files for better human viewing the night of Day 6. Today, learned more about grid, reordered Books page for mobile using CSS, changed font style, and readjusted measurements for all devices.

**Thoughts:** I feel awesome now that I finally put my vision into reality. The only downside is wondering whether or not my code has proper design. I feel that there is too much repetition and that all the files are unnecessarily complicated.

**Today's Progress:** I began merging the CSS of my Books page into the CSS of my homepage.

**Thoughts:** I almost gave up and decided to just keep two CSS files, but not having only one CSS file just doesn't feel neat. So I pushed on and so far, the two are merging well. By the way, I just learned a better way to design this log from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-transform-your-100daysofcode-log-into-a-visual-experience-d048334af8d9/">Joe Warren</a>. I will try to edit this log and improve it in the following days. I am starting today and I am sharing the image below as a marker of how my this log looks today, before I begin editing it.

**Today's Progress:** I finally merged the CSS of my Books page and my homepage!

**Thoughts:** I am having a headache today and I am a bit sleepless. Still, when it is code, I'm just hooked. :) By the way, I'm also developing a table of contents for this log. You can find the TOC at the top of this log. I do it outside of my 100DaysOfCode hours, though.

<img alt="The finished look of my Poems page" src="https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img2.JPG">

**Today's Progress:** Having already set the measurements for the rest of the website, whatever followed next was fast. I added and finished a Poems page, and then I started working on my Programming page. I had to pause my 100DaysOfCode timer to create web content and gather images.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how quickly the coding today went. It is even faster than drag-and-drop on Wix! All that I need to do now is to write the web content for my Programming page.

<img alt="The new files in my repo" src="https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img3.JPG">

**Today's Progress:** I finished the web content for my Programming page and started uploading the new files to my repo. The live version of my site is now 50% up-to-date. I started working on my Shop page, adding product images to my repo and unhiding products Zazzle had hidden.

**Thoughts:** Even though it has been the plan, I was scared to add the new files to my repo. Because I feared destroying my website forever. There are still errors I need to fix, but I'm relieved it worked!

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on my Shop page, but the next step was to write web content for it and that wasn't coding. So I proceeded to fixing errors on my live site and editing files in my repo to get enough coding done today.

**Thoughts:** I do not know why Zazzle is taking too long to unhide my products. I also do not know why the lines of code in my books.html file can't get aligned. I'm trying to have neat code. By the way, I changed my GitHub appearance to dark so that I wouldn't be squinting at my screen all the time.

**Today's Progress:** I returned to Codepen on the night of Day 14 to finish my Shop page. Today, I finished my Contact page, edited my repo files, and fixed errors in the mobile view. I also resumed studying JavaScript. I also followed <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/wydman_dev/status/1657091723820949524">Adrian Wydmanski's</a> advice.

<img alt="My freeCodeCamp progress" src="https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img9.JPG">

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to concatenate variables to form strings, the different ways to manipulate different types of arrays, how to create functions in JavaScript, and how to create a function that outputs the sum of two number arguments.

**Thoughts:** I'm surprised JavaScript actually sees a difference between data types, because the C programmer in me was starting to get an OCD attack with the way JavaScript seems to mix up the different data types. By the way, this is Day 2 of me not coming up with something to write on my About page.

**Today's Progress:** I added a privacy policy to my website, updated the README file, and cited sources in my CSS file. I added my Camp NaNoWriMo 2023 Winner badge to my blog, and added grayscale to all of the HTML widgets. I edited the HTML/CSS of my 7 Cups profile.

**Thoughts:** I feel so tired, but I feel happy about all the things I finished today. I do not know why my 7 Cups profile is not cooperating with most of my code, though. To lighten up the mood, here is a cute dog GIF I tried (and failed) to add to my 7 Cups profile.

**Today's Progress:** I returned to GitHub at midnight of Day 15 (or morning of Day 16) to fix the CSS of the privacy policy link in my website and improve the README file of my Blogger widgets repo. Today, I learned all about switch statements in JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I should be studying JavaScript continuously to properly cook my brain, but my OCD keeps reminding me that the README files of all of my repos need to be improved, I might not make it to the 7 Cups bio designers team because my profile doesn't look the part, my About page is still not done ...

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img15.JPG)

**Today's Progress:** I learned to use bracket notation as much as possible instead of just dot notation, learned how to build and work with JavaScript objects, and met the JavaScript cousins of the infamous C villains called "loops" and "recursion". Being JavaScript doesn't make them any friendlier.

**Thoughts:** I wonder why freeCodeCamp accepts my solution as correct when I use bracket notation, and rejects it as incorrect when I use dot notation. There must be something wrong in my understanding of dot notation.

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the space-saving, time-saving conditional (ternary) operators. Then I tried to get used to recursion.

**Thoughts:** The photo above is me trying to work out the logic of freeCodeCamp's recursion --- and failing (I used .pop() instead of .unshift()). The photo below is me using <a target="_blank" href="https://playcode.io">Playcode</a> to try a technique taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/train-your-mind-to-think-recursively-in-5-steps-8f85c0e0eb81">Sara A.

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Basic JavaScript of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Maybe I'm still confused, but recursion appears to not follow the usual order of execution of code. It doesn't even appear to follow the order of loops. It's like the lowest line of code gets executed before the higher lines of code. I might still be confused.

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create a function that returns the sum of each of its arguments added together with the rest parameter, copy an array to another array without using a loop, and use destructuring assignment for objects and arays.

**Thoughts:** I should remember that the apostrophe is not the backtick. \*saves to permanent memory\*

**Today's Progress:** I finished the ES6 part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures of freeCodeCamp and started the Regular Expressions part. I am finally getting to the part where the course teaches how to use JavaScript on a website.

**Thoughts:** I have been worried that this course would never mention how to apply what I'm studying in a way that would help me finish an actual, complete software and that it would all be just theory. I got excited today when I found out my worries aren't correct. 😊

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img22.JPG)

**Today's Progress:** I learned about all forms of matching in JavaScript, each of which are achieved only through a single character. I also learned about extracting matches, selecting characters that aren't matches, and the global flag.

**Thoughts:** I use WordPad as a duck debugger. Its purpose is to help me figure out the logic of programs, but I often end up typing random things that have no connection with anything. Sometimes, I type out my frustrations. Today, I typed, "WHY IS MATCHING STRINGS WITH JAVASCRIPT SO EASY?!!!"

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img23.JPG)

It was super hard with C. In fact, student sentiments about transitioning from C in <a target="_blank" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">CS50x</a> is pretty common. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/m3gkpe/when_you_see_david_do_speller_in_like_15_lines_of/">This</a> is one of them.

**Today's Progress:** Today, I learned to not underestimate regex just because they are small, alone, and are mostly neither letters nor numbers. The characters are actually meant to be grouped together in particular patterns depending on what needs to be done with the program.

**Thoughts:** I didn't expect the characters were supposed to be used in groups. It's like hieroglyphics. My eyeballs could almost spin around and around just staring at each character and trying to remember what it means and how it relates to the other characters.

**Today's Progress:** I was finally starting to figure out regex when that section ended. I continued to Debugging, where I learned one of the uses of the console in Chrome and accidentally crashed my browser after creating an infinite loop. I finished Debugging and now I'm in Basic Data Structures.

**Thoughts:** I'm thrilled that I'm finally in data structures. I went to freeCodeCamp in the hope that it would help me come up with an idea on how to solve the data structures part of CS50x.

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img26.JPG)

Not hoping for a complete idea. Just hoping for at least a glimpse of an idea. Just gonna look into what JavaScript data structures are like, maybe I'll "sense" something for figuring out the ones in C.

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the cool splice() and slice(). I also learned about indexOf(). The Basic Data Structures section of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course of freeCodeCamp also let me review the types data structures I already learned earlier in the course.

**Thoughts:** Whenever I lurk in programmers' chats to observe how real programmers talk, I always see some of them talking about splice(). I always thought splice() sounded cool, but now I know it really is cool. It's like cut-and-paste, but it's more like cut-and-paste-and-replace.
