# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to fork a GitHub repo without using a CLI, updated CSS of the Writing page of my website, added images of my books, and grouped files into folders in GitHub repo of my website (learned how to add folders into my repo in the process).

**Thoughts:** It was daunting to return to working on my website after almost a whole month, but now I am starting to regain my focus on it. Life would be easier if I would use a CLI, but I am avoiding because it only means I would have to install programs in my computer. I do not feel very confident about the memory of my computer yet. The memory looks small.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Upcoming version of my Writing page](https://codepen.io/charlenedelfin/pen/XWPOgyg)
2. [GitHub repo of the live version of my website](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/charlenedelfin.github.io)
