<h2 align="center">Day 1: May 1, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to fork a GitHub repo without using a CLI, updated CSS of the Writing page of my website, added images of my books, and grouped files into folders in GitHub repo of my website (learned how to add folders into my repo in the process).

**Thoughts:** It was daunting to return to working on my website after almost a whole month, but now I am starting to regain my focus on it. Life would be easier if I would use a CLI, but I am avoiding because it only means I would have to install programs in my computer. I do not feel very confident about the memory of my computer yet. The memory looks small.

<h2 align="center" id="2">Day 2: May 2, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Returned to GitHub on night of Day 1 to add code to verify website ownership on Google Search Console. This afternoon, used flexbox to organize the photos of my books on my Writing page.

**Thoughts:** This is the first time I'm using Google Search Console. I do not like the way my Writing page appears at the moment, it triggers my obsessive-compulsive tendencies. It really does. I got lost in my own code today, though. Because I forgot to comment my CSS last March, and because I use generic values for my id attributes.

<h2 align="center" id="3">Day 3: May 3, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Commented my CSS, merged the CSS of my homepage and Writing page, fixed some errors, decided to apply most of my CSS to the whole website for consistency, and organized the contents of my CSS file from "sitewide", to "per-page", and to "per screen". (CSS file does not contain those specific words, but it's in this organization.)

**Thoughts:** I'm more focused on coding today.

<h2 align="center" id="4">Day 4: May 4, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Returned to Codepen the night of Day 3 to give my website a more responsive design. Also renamed its Writing page to "Books". Today, customized the measurements of the product div elements and designed the buttons to match the overall site design.

**Thoughts:** I feel frustrated with how my buttons are not aligned.

<h2 align="center" id="5">Day 5: May 5, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Tried using CSS grid to align the buttons in the Books page, failed, and returned to flexbox. Learned about grid in the process. Spent remaining time figuring out why main and footer were overlapping. Changed background colors of flexboxes for clearer view of what might be happening.

**Thoughts:** I still feel upset that the buttons are not aligned. Whenever I align them, problems happen. The images disappear, the gaps between the images and the product titles get too big, or some of the images get bigger than the other images. Maybe I should work on the layout of the whole page first before proceeding to the products, the problem could be in the overall layout.

<h2 align="center" id="6">Day 6: May 6, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Resorted to using a blank doc as a sort of duck debugger for mapping out the logic of my code. Figured out why main and footer were overlapping. Part of main was a flexbox within an element, and footer was in a flexbox with a section from main. Footer was following a measurement that had nothing to do with the display case. Fixed it by adding a gap between items of the outer flexbox. Removed background colors. Moved page intro from behind the navbar by increasing margins. Started working on aligning the buttons again.

**Thoughts:** Being unable to fix the footer left me a bit depressed. Now that it's fixed, all of those emotions are suddenly gone. I feel so inspired, I have returned to attempting to align the buttons again. There is hope.

<h2 align="center" id="7">Day 7: May 7, 2023</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about CSS grid, restructured HTML to align everything on my Books page, made images zoom on hover in devices that use a cursor, and edited all files for better human viewing the night of Day 6. Today, learned more about grid, reordered Books page for mobile using CSS, changed font style, and readjusted measurements for all devices.

**Thoughts:** I feel awesome now that I finally put my vision into reality. The only downside is wondering whether or not my code has proper design. I feel that there is too much repetition and that all the files are unnecessarily complicated.

**Today's Progress:** I began merging the CSS of my Books page into the CSS of my homepage.

**Thoughts:** I almost gave up and decided to just keep two CSS files, but not having only one CSS file just doesn't feel neat. So I pushed on and so far, the two are merging well. By the way, I just learned a better way to design this log from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-transform-your-100daysofcode-log-into-a-visual-experience-d048334af8d9/">Joe Warren</a>. I will try to edit this log and improve it in the following days. I am starting today and I am sharing the image below as a marker of how my this log looks today, before I begin editing it.

**Today's Progress:** I finally merged the CSS of my Books page and my homepage!

**Thoughts:** I am having a headache today and I am a bit sleepless. Still, when it is code, I'm just hooked. :) By the way, I'm also developing a table of contents for this log. You can find the TOC at the top of this log. I do it outside of my 100DaysOfCode hours, though.

<img alt="The finished look of my Poems page" src="https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img2.JPG">

**Today's Progress:** Having already set the measurements for the rest of the website, whatever followed next was fast. I added and finished a Poems page, and then I started working on my Programming page. I had to pause my 100DaysOfCode timer to create web content and gather images.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how quickly the coding today went. It is even faster than drag-and-drop on Wix! All that I need to do now is to write the web content for my Programming page.

**Today's Progress:** I finished the web content for my Programming page and started uploading the new files to my repo. The live version of my site is now 50% up-to-date. I started working on my Shop page, adding product images to my repo and unhiding products Zazzle had hidden.

**Thoughts:** Even though it has been the plan, I was scared to add the new files to my repo. Because I feared destroying my website forever. There are still errors I need to fix, but I'm relieved it worked!

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on my Shop page, but the next step was to write web content for it and that wasn't coding. So I proceeded to fixing errors on my live site and editing files in my repo to get enough coding done today.

**Thoughts:** I do not know why Zazzle is taking too long to unhide my products. I also do not know why the lines of code in my books.html file can't get aligned. I'm trying to have neat code. By the way, I changed my GitHub appearance to dark so that I wouldn't be squinting at my screen all the time.

**Today's Progress:** I returned to Codepen on the night of Day 14 to finish my Shop page. Today, I finished my Contact page, edited my repo files, and fixed errors in the mobile view. I also resumed studying JavaScript. I also followed <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/wydman_dev/status/1657091723820949524">Adrian Wydmanski's</a> advice.

<img alt="My freeCodeCamp progress" src="https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img9.JPG">

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to concatenate variables to form strings, the different ways to manipulate different types of arrays, how to create functions in JavaScript, and how to create a function that outputs the sum of two number arguments.

**Thoughts:** I'm surprised JavaScript actually sees a difference between data types, because the C programmer in me was starting to get an OCD attack with the way JavaScript seems to mix up the different data types. By the way, this is Day 2 of me not coming up with something to write on my About page.

**Today's Progress:** I added a privacy policy to my website, updated the README file, and cited sources in my CSS file. I added my Camp NaNoWriMo 2023 Winner badge to my blog, and added grayscale to all of the HTML widgets. I edited the HTML/CSS of my 7 Cups profile.

**Thoughts:** I feel so tired, but I feel happy about all the things I finished today. I do not know why my 7 Cups profile is not cooperating with most of my code, though. To lighten up the mood, here is a cute dog GIF I tried (and failed) to add to my 7 Cups profile.

**Today's Progress:** I returned to GitHub at midnight of Day 15 (or morning of Day 16) to fix the CSS of the privacy policy link in my website and improve the README file of my Blogger widgets repo. Today, I learned all about switch statements in JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I should be studying JavaScript continuously to properly cook my brain, but my OCD keeps reminding me that the README files of all of my repos need to be improved, I might not make it to the 7 Cups bio designers team because my profile doesn't look the part, my About page is still not done ...

**Today's Progress:** I learned to use bracket notation as much as possible instead of just dot notation, learned how to build and work with JavaScript objects, and met the JavaScript cousins of the infamous C villains called "loops" and "recursion". Being JavaScript doesn't make them any friendlier.

**Thoughts:** I wonder why freeCodeCamp accepts my solution as correct when I use bracket notation, and rejects it as incorrect when I use dot notation. There must be something wrong in my understanding of dot notation.

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the space-saving, time-saving conditional (ternary) operators. Then I tried to get used to recursion.

**Thoughts:** The photo above is me trying to work out the logic of freeCodeCamp's recursion --- and failing (I used .pop() instead of .unshift()). The photo below is me using <a target="_blank" href="https://playcode.io">Playcode</a> to try a technique taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/train-your-mind-to-think-recursively-in-5-steps-8f85c0e0eb81">Sara A.

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Basic JavaScript of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Maybe I'm still confused, but recursion appears to not follow the usual order of execution of code. It doesn't even appear to follow the order of loops. It's like the lowest line of code gets executed before the higher lines of code. I might still be confused.

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create a function that returns the sum of each of its arguments added together with the rest parameter, copy an array to another array without using a loop, and use destructuring assignment for objects and arays.

**Thoughts:** I should remember that the apostrophe is not the backtick. \*saves to permanent memory\*

**Today's Progress:** I finished the ES6 part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures of freeCodeCamp and started the Regular Expressions part. I am finally getting to the part where the course teaches how to use JavaScript on a website.

**Thoughts:** I have been worried that this course would never mention how to apply what I'm studying in a way that would help me finish an actual, complete software and that it would all be just theory. I got excited today when I found out my worries aren't correct. 😊

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img22.JPG)

**Today's Progress:** I learned about all forms of matching in JavaScript, each of which are achieved only through a single character. I also learned about extracting matches, selecting characters that aren't matches, and the global flag.

**Thoughts:** I use WordPad as a duck debugger. Its purpose is to help me figure out the logic of programs, but I often end up typing random things that have no connection with anything. Sometimes, I type out my frustrations. Today, I typed, "WHY IS MATCHING STRINGS WITH JAVASCRIPT SO EASY?!!!"

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img23.JPG)

It was super hard with C. In fact, student sentiments about transitioning from C in <a target="_blank" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">CS50x</a> is pretty common. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/m3gkpe/when_you_see_david_do_speller_in_like_15_lines_of/">This</a> is one of them.

**Today's Progress:** Today, I learned to not underestimate regex just because they are small, alone, and are mostly neither letters nor numbers. The characters are actually meant to be grouped together in particular patterns depending on what needs to be done with the program.

**Thoughts:** I didn't expect the characters were supposed to be used in groups. It's like hieroglyphics. My eyeballs could almost spin around and around just staring at each character and trying to remember what it means and how it relates to the other characters.

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img25.JPG)

**Today's Progress:** I was finally starting to figure out regex when that section ended. I continued to Debugging, where I learned one of the uses of the console in Chrome and accidentally crashed my browser after creating an infinite loop. I finished Debugging and now I'm in Basic Data Structures.

**Thoughts:** I'm thrilled that I'm finally in data structures. I went to freeCodeCamp in the hope that it would help me come up with an idea on how to solve the data structures part of CS50x.

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img26.JPG)

Not hoping for a complete idea. Just hoping for at least a glimpse of an idea. Just gonna look into what JavaScript data structures are like, maybe I'll "sense" something for figuring out the ones in C.

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the cool splice() and slice(). I also learned about indexOf(). The Basic Data Structures section of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course of freeCodeCamp also let me review the types data structures I already learned earlier in the course.

**Thoughts:** Whenever I lurk in programmers' chats to observe how real programmers talk, I always see some of them talking about splice(). I always thought splice() sounded cool, but now I know it really is cool. It's like cut-and-paste, but it's more like cut-and-paste-and-replace.

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Basic Data Structures section and continued to Basic Algorithm Scripting, where I get to solve problems using everything I learned so far. In the above image, I'm in the process of writing code for a program that finds the longest word in a sentence. I have learned to use console.log() to check if a part of my program is working, but I'm still working on my regex skills (that's why I have to use console.log() to check if my regex works).

**Thoughts:** I am worried why cosole.log() is printing "1". It's supposed to print "3". Also, I feel like I still think too much in C. I still turn strings into arrays and work with them per character. I should adjust to the differences between C and JavaScript. However, I prefer to use "werks" instead of "works". It's just more fun that way. Fun with intentional misspelling werks! 🙃

**Today's Progress:** I did a lot of coding today, strengthening my patience for looping over the same strings repetitively and checking for different things each time. I am slowing down in my progress through the course, but not because I'm left clueless as to what's going on, but because I write a lot of code in each lesson.

**Thoughts:** I wonder if I complicated the solutions for the lessons in Basic Algorithm Scripting, or if that's really how it's supposed to be. In another topic, I realized today how <a target="_blank" href="https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/Elliot_Alderson">Elliot Alderson</a> must be an extremely advanced genius. He can quickly figure out what his other personalities have been programming. It took me many painful hours today to figure out the code I wrote last night, and I don't even have split personality. This was my code from last night:

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to change the case of letters in JavaScript, and then I started working on a problem that suggests I should use slice() and splice().

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to suffer from a great deal of boredom. There's nothing wrong with freeCodeCamp or anything or anyone, it's just my personality. I get bored quickly. I've been coping with this problem by coming up with ways to make things different each time, even when they're still really the same. Now maybe I should make my WordPad yellow so it looks different.

**Today's Progress:** I solved the problem from yesterday - which seemed to suggest that I should solve it using slice() and splice() - by not using slice() or splice(). I proceeded to the next problem, where I am not using anything new again and instead resorting to my C ways.

**Thoughts:** Ever since I started programming, I have been in only two very difficult situations: 1) Finding no existing solution to my problem, not even in Stack Overflow. And 2) Producing the correct code that returns the correct data, but still having tests keep insisting that it's wrong. My code above really returns 3, and the test says it should return 3, but the test won't accept my code as correct. Maybe I should delete the whole thing and rewrite the same thing, that is sometimes the solution because the screen seems to sort of freeze. If that's not the problem, maybe I should make it return an array. If not that either, I'll come up with something. \*grim facial expression\*

**Today's Progress:** I figured out what was wrong with my code from yesterday, and finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting section. I proceeded to the Object Oriented Programming section, where I finally learned what constructors are all about. Constructors were suddenly introduced in the ES6 section, but I had no idea what they were and I had to guess my way around the problems that involved them.

**Thoughts:** There's this common meme about programming.

I was in this situation at the end of Basic Algorithm Scripting. I was still trying to figure out which loop was which loop when my code passed.

**Today's Progress:** I learned more about objects, constructors, and methods, which are never seen bearing the name, "method", so it can get confusing. I also learned about prototypes, inheritance, instances, and the constructor property, which seems invisible in a constructor.

**Thoughts:** I kept falling asleep in front of the computer while programming today because my kitten slept on my legs. I investigated further into the mystery and found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-cats-make-me-sleepy-Is-it-because-they-like-to-sleep-often-or-something-else">this thread on Quora</a>. It's strange there's no scientific research on it yet. I sometimes wonder if sleeping kittens release a sort of sedative on human skin that goes into the bloodstream and makes us zzzzz. 😀

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Object Oriented Programming section and continued to the Functional Programming section. I learned about mixins, modules, closure, and overriding inherited methods. I am now trying to figure out functional programming.

**Thoughts:** I found the Object Oriented Programming section fun and unusually easy, but now I find the next section hard.

**Today's Progress:** This is the first time in my freeCodeCamp life that I got stuck in one lesson for a day. Well, one hour, actually. I have only one hour for programming today, it's a busy day. Thankfully, I have figured out so far that this problem is asking me to remove the tabs that are supposed to stay.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am "on the scent" of a solution for this problem. I can almost reach it with my mind, it is near ... unless it's another dead-end. If only I had more time today. But it's a few minutes to midnight now and I should still do the laundry, feed the cats, etc. Then early again tomorrow.

**Today's Progress:** I solved the problem from last night using <a href="https://playcode.io">Playcode</a>

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img40.JPG)

and duck debugging.

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img41.JPG)

Then I proceeded further into the Functional Programming section to finally learn about .map() and .filter().

**Thoughts:** I feel relieved about solving the problem from last night. The problem haunted me all night. By sunrise, I conditioned my mind to be calm and clear enough to tackle it. I was so focused on solving code, there was a bit of collateral damage.

The first "victim" was my old tablet. I opened it while waiting for my rice to get cooked. Look at it, it's pretty:

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img43.jpg)

I think the CPU is the small rectangle, the medium rectangle is the RAM, and the big rectangle is for permanent storage. Unless I'm wrong ... 🤔

The second was Meta. When I still had few online friends, I always replied to each of their posts before making my own post. Now that it could take my whole lifetime to reply to each of their posts, I just make sure I don't miss their birthdays. I was sending birthday greetings to my Facebook friends when Facebook sent this error message:

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img39.JPG)

Is this a variable, or a function that mutates an array? But it could really be just an error message.

**Today's Progress:** I learned more about slice() and concat(). I learned that concat() actually doesn't mutate an array, just like slice(). Then I started studying reduce(). In the above image, I was testing if there was something wrong with my usage of parseInt().

**Thoughts:** I can't believe I am using all these new methods and I actually get some of them to work. I feel like I'm just blindly making my way through this course and just getting lucky. I feel like Peter Parker in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTGwYV0ucsM">scene</a>. It was his first web-swing and he still didn't have much of a clue about what was happening.

**Today's Progress:** I learned about parseFloat() in my struggle to solve the problem from yesterday. I also met my old friends, the conditional (ternary) operators and regex. In the image above, I was trying to figure out the join method.

**Thoughts:** In the image above, I wonder why they say to not use the replace method. Reading it, my brain was like, "What is the replace method?"

**Today's Progress:** I finished Functional Programming and proceeded to Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. In the process, I learned about currying and the arity of functions. Currying is cool because it allows additional customization in programming.

**Thoughts:** Currying makes me think of chickn curry.

**Today's Progress:** I am learning more and more about .filter(). I also went deeper into the usage of .indexOf(), and learned about a new thing called "arguments object". I am starting to really use JavaScript, and not some hybrid of C and JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** My OCD still finds the ways of JavaScript icky, JavaScript mixes everything. Still, there is no choice but to use them with the problems in Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. This section is helping me start to build a kind of tolerance for JavaScript.

**Today's Progress:** I solved the problem from yesterday with nested for loops. I just figured that regular expressions and .filter() wouldn't work for that particular problem. Now I am trying to figure out this array of objects and the second argument.

**Thoughts:** I have started to open the rest of the course in another tab and look through the previous lessons for ideas on how to go through my current lessons, like using a manual. I often feel totally clueless now, or that I reached the end of all of my ideas.

**Today's Progress:** I resorted to using the stare-down method. It's exactly how it sounds. You give your code a good stare-down until the bugs reveal themselves. In the process, I learned about getOwnPropertyNames, new combinations of regular expressions, and how to find consonants in a string with JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** The Intermediate Algorithm Scripting is terribly mind-bending. It's merciless. 😓 But my hardships here are helping me remember JavaScript functions and their uses better. For example, I just discovered the helpfulness of .every(). It simplifies a loop when it can be simplified.

**Today's Progress:** I finished two lessons, and I'm starting to become comfortable with JavaScript. I figure out problems and come up with solutions faster. I also know JavaScript methods better, when I used to remember their names but not their behavior.

**Thoughts:** I also just found out that the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course might not be enough for me to figure out how to add the JavaScript features that I want to add to my website (I want to add a collapsible menu and a loader). I might have to take Front End Development Certification, too. Fortunately, this course is enough for me to get an idea for solutions for Speller of CS50x. 😀

**Today's Progress:** I finished two more lessons today. The image above was when I was looking at the bug in the latest lesson. I no longer always need console.log(), and can mentally visualize loops better than before.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how it's all starting to seem simple. When I focus on the task that has to be done, it becomes easier. It's hard only when I focus on the names of the parts of the code and the names of its logic.

**Today's Progress:** I finished one more lesson today. I can now work with many arrays in multiple loops. I said yesterday I no longer always needed console.log(), but now I decided to make it a habit to use it. Always using console.log() helps me spot bugs before they mess up the whole program.

**Thoughts:** I also attended the first lecture of the Cybersecurity course of CS50x live on Zoom while programming.

![Image](https://github.com/charlenedelfin/100-days-delfin-log/blob/master/img/img52.JPG)

The plan was to listen to it while programming, but I kept hearing lots of awesome things so I kept switching to the Zoom tab to check them out and leaving the freeCodeCamp tab. I ended up watching the whole lecture, and the Q&A also. 😊

**Today's Progress:** I finished three more lessons. I finally got to work with the Fibonacci sequence. I also learned to look for prime numbers with JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Looking for prime numbers seemed impossible at first, but with the help of console.log() and online resources, I was able to find my way around the bugs. I'm starting to consider console.log() as like that flashlight you use in difficult hidden-object games.

**Today's Progress:** I finished three more lessons. I learned about isArray() while working with nested arrays and fromCharCode() while working with binary code. I also learned that fromCharCode() returns Chinese characters when you don't use parseInt().

**Thoughts:** I like forCharCode(). I have always thought it'd be wonderful if there was something that could quickly decode binary code. 🙂

**Today's Progress:** I learned about .isInteger(), and I finally did my own currying. In the first image above, I was working on my first object constructor. In the second image, I was reviewing the lessons that taught about constructors to remember how they were done. In the third image, I created my own constructor to see if I understood constructors correctly.

**Thoughts:** Seeing that I am near the end of this section gets me excited! 😄

**Today's Progress:** After almost going around the internet to learn about how to add methods to object constructors, I finally added the first methods that were required in the problem from yesterday. I learned that setters are just a variation of a method, you just have to make sure its logic adds up with the logic of the rest of the constructor.

**Thoughts:** Even though it really made life easier, I was never confident about being given complete functions in programming. I tended to be curious about what made them work. The problem from yesterday - which also became the problem for today - gave me a glimpse of how getters and setters work.
